# Railcast Design System — "Semaphore"

**Phase 2 of the redesign.** The production specification for the Ambient-first direction selected in `direction-study.md`.
Version 1.0 · July 2026 · Android / Jetpack Compose · Every contrast figure in this document is machine-verified.

---

## 0 · The four laws

Everything below derives from these. When a decision is ambiguous, resolve it against these in order.

1. **Colour is never load-bearing.** Every status is icon + word + colour. Remove all colour and the app still works. (FR-10.2, invariant 4)
2. **Confidence is a data dimension.** No live value renders without an epistemic state. An estimate must *look* estimated before it is read. (FR-11.1, FR-2.2)
3. **The consequence outranks the datum.** "12 min late" is the train's fact. "You reach Bhopal ~16:49" is the user's answer. The answer gets the larger type.
4. **Degrade, never block.** Every component has a cached, an offline, and an unknown rendering. No component may be blank on no-network. (FR-9.1)

## 1 · Colour

### 1.1 Structure

Three themes, one shape. `RailcastColors` is a data class with identical fields across Light, Dark, and Sunlight, selected via CompositionLocal — so a theme switch is a value swap, never a branch in component code.

The palette separates two families that must never be confused:

- **Brand** (`brand`, `brandSoft`) — identity and tap affordance. Never used to signal state.
- **Signal** (`green`, `amber`, `red` + soft tints) — railway semaphore semantics. Never used for decoration.

*Brand ≠ signal* is a hard rule. A blue "Track" button and a green "ON TIME" chip must never trade colours, because the user learns signal meaning within one session and decorative reuse destroys it.

### 1.2 The verified palette

All values below are the **shipped, corrected** tokens. Figures are WCAG 2.2 contrast ratios computed on the pair that actually renders.

| Role | Light | Dark | Sunlight |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bg` | `#E7ECEF` | `#081115` | `#FFFFFF` |
| `surface` | `#FFFFFF` | `#0F2129` | `#FFFFFF` |
| `surface2` | `#F1F4F6` | `#15303A` | `#F2F2F2` |
| `ink` (primary) | `#0F2A33` · 15.01:1 | `#EAF3F4` · 14.67:1 | `#000000` · 21.00:1 |
| `ink2` (secondary) | `#54696F` · 5.79:1 | `#9DB4BB` · 7.62:1 | `#2A2A2A` · 14.35:1 |
| `ink3` (tertiary) | `#5B6E75` · 5.34:1 | `#708A92` · 4.52:1 | `#555555` · 7.46:1 |
| `line` | `#DCE3E7` | `#1E3B45` | `#BBBBBB` |
| `brand` | `#2743C4` · 7.82:1 | `#8098FF` · 6.18:1 | `#1D33A0` · 10.33:1 |
| `green` GOOD | `#126C40` | `#3DBB77` | `#095731` |
| `amber` WARN | `#8B5208` | `#E7A542` | `#6E4100` |
| `red` BAD | `#C03C3C` | `#E36868` | `#852424` |
| `board` | `#0F2A33` | `#06151A` | `#FFFFFF` |
| `boardGreen` | `#3DE08A` · 8.74:1 | `#3DE08A` · 10.82:1 | `#095731` |
| `boardAmber` | `#FFC24D` · 9.34:1 | `#FFC24D` · 11.57:1 | `#6E4100` |
| `boardInk` | `#7FA6AE` · 5.69:1 | `#6E969E` · 5.77:1 | `#333333` · 12.63:1 |

### 1.3 The composite rule *(the trap this system exists to prevent)*

`StatusChip` renders signal text on a **soft tint**, and in Light/Dark that tint is alpha-blended (`0x24` = 14%) over whatever sits beneath it. The pair that reaches the eye is therefore:

```
    text  ⟶  [ tint @14% ]  ⟶  surface OR bg
             └── composite this before measuring ──┘
```

Measuring signal-on-surface instead overstates contrast by roughly **one full stop**. Under the original tokens that produced GOOD at 3.66:1 and WARN at 2.94:1 (2.50:1 over `bg`) — all shipping, all failing, all passing a test that measured the wrong thing.

**Rule:** any token pair is measured *after compositing*, against the **darkest backdrop the component can sit on**. Enforced by `SemaphoreContrastTest`, which iterates every `StatusLevel` × `{surface, bg}` × three themes.

**Rule:** tokens carry ≥0.1 margin above their threshold. A token sitting exactly at 4.50 flips to 4.49 under `Float` math and fails in CI but not in review.

### 1.4 Thresholds

| Surface | Minimum | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Fact-bearing text (Light/Dark) | **4.5:1** | WCAG 2.2 AA normal text |
| Fact-bearing text (Sunlight) | **7:1** | AAA — the platform in direct sun, FR-5.3 |
| Brand as tap affordance | **3:1** | WCAG 2.2 non-text contrast (1.4.11) |
| Focus ring vs adjacent | **3:1** | WCAG 2.2 focus appearance (2.4.13) |

### 1.5 Colour-blind safety

Green/amber/red is the worst possible triad for deuteranopia and protanopia — and it is non-negotiable, because it is railway semaphore and the domain owns it. It is made safe by **three independent redundancies**, not by palette choice:

1. **Icon differs by shape** — ✓ circle, ⚠ triangle, ✕ cross. Distinguishable in pure luminance.
2. **The word is always present** — "ON TIME", "LATE 12m", "CANCELLED".
3. **Luminance differs across levels**, so the three are separable in greyscale.

Verification: render any status surface in greyscale. If you can still identify the state, it passes. Colour is the third signal, never the first.

## 2 · Typography

### 2.1 Two families, one job each

| Family | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Humanist system sans** (platform default) | All prose, labels, names, actions | Free Indic-script coverage across all 12 languages (FR-10.1) with zero APK cost, and it inherits the user's font. A bundled Latin-first face would fail Devanagari/Bengali/Tamil rendering — which would break the product's core inclusion promise to save 400KB. |
| **`RailcastMono`** (`FontFamily.Monospace`) | Every number that refreshes: times, delays, platforms, fares, PNR mask | **Tabular numerals.** A proportional `1` is narrower than `8`, so a live-refreshing ETA reflows on every poll. Jitter reads as instability, and instability reads as untrustworthy. |

`TabularNumberStyle` also pins `textDirection = Ltr` so numbers stay LTR inside RTL locales — a `16:49` must never render as `49:16`.

### 2.2 Scale

Mapped onto Material 3 `Typography` so Compose defaults work unmodified.

| Token | Size / Weight | Tracking | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `displaySmall` | 30sp · ExtraBold | −0.03em | **The answer.** One per screen, maximum. |
| `headlineLarge` | 28sp · Bold | −0.02em | Screen titles |
| `headlineMedium` | 22sp · Bold | −0.02em | Section heads, board hero secondary |
| `titleLarge` | 18sp · Bold | 0 | Card titles, train names |
| `titleMedium` | 15sp · SemiBold | 0 | Row primary |
| `bodyLarge` | 15sp · Normal | 0 | Prose, explanations |
| `bodyMedium` | 13sp · Normal | 0 | Supporting detail |
| `labelLarge` | 13sp · SemiBold | 0 | Buttons, chips |
| `labelSmall` | 10.5sp · SemiBold | 0 | Freshness stamps, meta |

Negative tracking on large sizes only — it tightens display type optically, and would harm legibility below ~20sp.

### 2.3 The one-answer rule

**At most one `displaySmall` per screen.** If two things are that large, neither is the answer. This is the typographic expression of Law 3, and it is the fastest review check available: open any screen, count the biggest text. If the count isn't exactly one, the hierarchy is wrong.

### 2.4 Scaling

All sizes in `sp`, honouring OS text size (FR-10.3).

**Known deviation — the app currently caps text scaling at 1.3×.** `RailcastTheme` clamps `LocalDensity.fontScale` to `MAX_FONT_SCALE = 1.3f` app-wide, because past that point existing layouts clip. So a user who sets 200% system text receives 130%.

This is a deliberate trade that is nonetheless **an accessibility failure**, and it should not be described as anything else:

- WCAG 2.2 **1.4.4 Resize text** requires 200% without loss of content or function. The clamp does not meet it.
- FR-10.3 requires OS text-size "honoured with reflow". The clamp honours it only up to 130%.
- The users most affected are exactly persona P1 (elderly, vernacular-first) — the primary persona.

**The correct fix is reflow, not clamping**: no fixed-height text containers, no `maxLines` without `ellipsis`, every card sized by content, and horizontal rows that wrap to vertical stacks past a threshold. That is per-screen work across all features and is tracked as its own change — it must not be done by simply raising the constant, which would trade clipping for silent content loss.

Until then, this system does **not** claim 1.4.4 conformance. See §9.2.

---

## 3 · Spacing & geometry

### 3.1 Spacing — 4dp base

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `xs` | 4dp | icon ↔ label |
| `sm` | 8dp | inside chips |
| `md` | 12dp | list gaps |
| `lg` | 16dp | card padding |
| `xl` | 24dp | screen gutter |
| `xxl` | 32dp | section breaks |

One scale. Ad-hoc values are a review failure — before this scale existed the app used 12/16/20/24/32 arbitrarily and cards read as if from different kits.

### 3.2 Radius

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `sm` | 12dp | inputs, rows |
| `md` | 16dp | cards |
| `lg` | 20dp | board hero |
| `full` | 999dp | chips, pills |

### 3.3 Touch & ergonomics

- **Minimum target 48dp**, always, including visually smaller elements — pad the touch area, not the pixels. (FR-10.3)
- **Minimum 8dp between adjacent targets** so a moving thumb on a moving train cannot straddle two.
- **Primary actions live in the bottom third.** Nothing requiring a decision sits in a top corner.
- **Destructive actions are never in the thumb arc.** Delete, mute, and revoke-share require deliberate reach — friction is the safety mechanism.

---

## 4 · The Confidence System

The system's signature, and the deepest available moat: no incumbent renders epistemic status at all.

### 4.1 Levels

```kotlin
enum class Confidence { CERTAIN, ESTIMATED, STALE, UNKNOWN }
```

| Level | Meaning | Render | Copy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CERTAIN` | Observed and fresh | `ink`, crisp edge, mono numerals | `16:49` |
| `ESTIMATED` | Interpolated or predicted | `estimate` ink, **dashed underline**, slow breathe | `~16:49` |
| `STALE` | Cached, past TTL | `ink2` + freshness strip beside it | `16:49 · 14:02` |
| `UNKNOWN` | Upstream has no value | Em-dash, never zero, never blank | `—` |

### 4.1a Confidence never rides on opacity *(a correction)*

The obvious way to make an estimate *look* less certain is to fade it. **That is wrong, and this system explicitly forbids it.**

Fading costs legibility, and it takes it from precisely the values the user needs most — the ETA is usually the single most important number on the screen. A first draft of these tokens set `ESTIMATED` to 60% ink and measured **2.53:1 in Light, 3.63:1 in Dark**, far below the 4.5:1 floor. The design intent was right; the channel was the worst possible choice.

Confidence therefore rides only on channels that cost nothing:

| Channel | Carries | Survives on |
|---|---|---|
| **Copy** — the `~` prefix | ESTIMATED | Everywhere, including Glance widgets and RemoteViews |
| **Edge** — dashed underline | ESTIMATED | In-app only |
| **Motion** — the breathe | ESTIMATED position marker | In-app only, reduced-motion off |
| **Adjacency** — freshness strip | STALE | Everywhere |
| **Semantics** — the word "estimated" | All | Screen readers |

`estimate` is a **full-contrast** token (= `ink2`) in all three themes, gated by `light/dark/sunlight_estimates_stay_readable`. Note that copy is the only channel that survives on every surface — which is why the `~` is a *rule*, not a flourish.

### 4.2 Rules

**No live value renders without a confidence level.** This is enforced at the component API: the primitives that display live data take `Confidence` as a **required** parameter. There is no default. A developer cannot forget to label an estimate, because the code will not compile.

That is the mechanism that turns FR-11.1 from a policy into a property.

**`UNKNOWN` renders as `—`, never `0`, never blank.** A missing platform number shown as blank reads as "no platform"; shown as `0` reads as a real platform. Both are lies. The em-dash is the only honest rendering.

**Confidence is announced, not just shown.** Screen readers receive "estimated arrival 4:49 PM" — the word "estimated" is in the `contentDescription`, because a sighted user gets it from the dashed edge and a blind user must get it from somewhere.

### 4.3 Where it appears

Every interpolated map position (FR-2.2 — never implied as GPS), every predicted delay (FR-2.6, with basis), every confirmation probability (FR-4.4), every future timeline entry, every value on a cached screen (FR-9.1).

---

## 5 · Component library

### 5.1 Primitives

| Component | Contract | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `StatusChip` | `icon, label, level` | The FR-10.2 atom. Single `contentDescription` for the whole chip so TalkBack reads "Late 12 minutes", not "warning triangle, late, 12". |
| `ConfidenceValue` | `value, confidence, ...` | Any live number. `Confidence` required. |
| `FreshnessStamp` | `updatedAt, isStale` | "updated 8s ago" / "cached 14:02". On every live surface (FR-2.5). |
| `LivePulse` | — | The one ambient animation. Respects reduced-motion. |
| `MonoNumber` | `text` | Tabular numerals, LTR-pinned. |

### 5.2 Composites

| Component | Purpose | Key rule |
|---|---|---|
| `BoardHero` | The answer block: state + consequence + freshness | Exactly one `displaySmall`. |
| `JourneyCard` | Stack row | Leads with **state**, not train identity. |
| `ThreadSpine` | Journey timeline | Sticky present; past crisp, future `ESTIMATED`. |
| `PlatformDiagram` | Coach position (FR-3.x) | Diagram is evidence; the *sentence* is the answer. |
| `PnrPass` | Ticket | Mask enforced at the type level (§5.4). |
| `BoardRow` | Station board row | Monospaced columns; cancelled rows keep position. |
| `PlanRow` | Comparison row | Hydrates progressively; never blocks the list. |

### 5.3 State vocabulary

Every data component implements four renderings. This is a completeness requirement, not a suggestion.

| State | Rendering |
|---|---|
| Loading | Skeleton matching final layout exactly — nothing reflows on arrival |
| Cached/offline | Real content + strip + `STALE` on every value |
| Error | Plain language + next step, never blames the user |
| Empty | Directive — always exactly one action |

### 5.4 The PNR mask is a type, not a discipline

```
PNR is never a String in UI or analytics code.
It is a MaskedPnr whose toString() yields ••••2882.
```

FR-4.3 and invariant 2 require masking in every surface *and every log*. A convention ("remember to mask") fails eventually. A type that **cannot express** the unmasked value fails never. The raw value exists only inside the encryption boundary.

---

## 6 · Iconography

### 6.1 Rules

- **Shape carries meaning before colour does** (§1.5). The status triad is circle / triangle / cross.
- **Icons are never alone for status.** Always icon + word. Icons may stand alone only for *navigation* affordances that also carry a visible label.
- **One optical weight** across the set. Mixed stroke weights are the fastest way to look unfinished.
- **24dp default**, 20dp inline with text, always inside a ≥48dp target.

### 6.2 Status set

| Level | Glyph | Shape logic |
|---|---|---|
| GOOD | ✓ in circle | Enclosed, settled |
| WARN | ! in triangle | Angular, attention |
| BAD | ✕ in circle | Crossed, terminal |
| NEUTRAL | • | No claim |
| ESTIMATED | ◐ | Half-filled — partial knowledge |

The current implementation uses emoji glyphs (keeping the APK lean — no icon font, serving NFR-1's <25MB budget). **Known limitation:** emoji rendering varies by OEM font, which weakens the shape-consistency guarantee. If this proves visually unstable across the device matrix, the fix is a small bundled vector set for the five status glyphs only — roughly 3KB, not a full icon font.

---

## 7 · Motion

### 7.1 Three laws

1. **Motion explains change; it never decorates.** If an animation doesn't teach where something came from or what became true, delete it.
2. **`PollController` is the only owner of time.** UI animates on *state change*, never on a `LaunchedEffect` timer. This is why refresh doesn't drain battery (NFR-3) and why animations can't desynchronise from data.
3. **Reduced-motion is honoured everywhere** (FR-10.3). Every animation degrades to an instant state swap. Nothing is lost — motion is never the only carrier of meaning.

### 7.2 Ladder

| Token | Duration | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `instantMs` | 90ms | chip select, toggle knob |
| `quickMs` | 180ms | crossfades, chip morphs |
| `settleMs` | 280ms | sheet detents, card expand, shared-element |
| `rollMs` | 420ms | the flap-roll; severity colour ease |
| `breatheMs` | 2400ms | the estimated-position marker |

Easing: `standardDecel` `(0, 0, 0.2, 1)` for entry; `emphasizedDecel` `(0.05, 0.7, 0.1, 1)` for anything the user should notice.

### 7.3 Signature interactions

**The flap-roll** (`rollMs`). When a delay figure changes, digits roll like a mechanical split-flap board. It is the one piece of deliberate character in the system — a nod to the departure board that Direction A was built around — and it does real work: it makes *change itself* perceptible, so a user glancing at a widget knows the number is new. Reduced-motion: instant swap.

**The breathe** (`breatheMs`, infinite). The estimated-position marker pulses slowly. This is the *only* looping animation in the app. Its slowness is the point: it says "alive but uncertain" without demanding attention. Reduced-motion: static marker with a dashed ring.

### 7.4 What we do not animate

Never: attention-grabbing loops on ads or upsells (there are none), bouncing CTAs, spinner theatre where a skeleton is honest, or celebratory motion on bad news. The chart-prepared celebration (FR-4.2) is the single exception, and it is small, one-shot, and earned.

---

## 8 · Haptics

Haptics are a **third redundant channel** alongside visual and audio — critical for a device in a pocket, in a noisy station, or held by a user with low vision.

| Pattern | Trigger | Feel |
|---|---|---|
| `TICK` | Chip select, toggle | Single light |
| `CONFIRM` | Save, alarm set | Light double |
| `ARRIVE` | Arrival alarm | Escalating, repeating until dismissed |
| `BAD_NEWS` | Cancellation received | Single heavy, once |
| `CELEBRATE` | Chart prepared, confirmed | Light triple |

**Rules.** Haptics accompany *state changes the user did not cause* — a passive refresh never buzzes. `BAD_NEWS` fires once and never repeats; repeated negative haptics are a dark pattern. All haptics respect system settings and quiet hours (FR-7.4), except `ARRIVE`, which is an alarm the user explicitly set and which is permitted to bypass (FR-7.3).

## 9 · Accessibility specification (WCAG 2.2 AA)

### 9.1 Verified now

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| 1.4.3 Contrast (minimum) | ✅ All fact-bearing pairs ≥4.5:1, composited. 9 CI tests. |
| 1.4.1 Use of colour | ✅ icon + word + colour everywhere; greyscale-legible |
| 1.4.11 Non-text contrast | ✅ brand ≥3:1 in all themes |
| 2.4.13 Focus appearance (token) | ✅ `focus` ≥3:1 vs surface, bg and surface2, all themes |
| 2.5.8 Target size (minimum) | ✅ ≥48dp, exceeds the 24dp AA floor |
| 1.3.1 Info & relationships | ✅ semantic grouping; chips carry one description |
| 4.1.2 Name, role, value (confidence) | ✅ epistemic state reaches TalkBack in words |

### 9.2 Requires device verification

These cannot be asserted from static analysis, and I am not claiming them:

| Criterion | Status / what must be tested |
|---|---|
| **1.4.4 Resize text** | ❌ **Not met.** Font scale clamped at 1.3× (§2.4). Needs per-screen reflow work. |
| **1.4.10 Reflow** | ❌ Blocked on the same work: 200% text × 320dp width, every screen |
| 2.4.13 Focus appearance | ⚠️ Token verified; the *rendered ring* (thickness, offset, keyboard + switch access) is untested |
| 4.1.2 Name, role, value | ⚠️ Confidence path covered; full TalkBack pass on all screens in EN and HI outstanding |
| 2.5.7 Dragging movements | ⚠️ Map pan and sheet drag need non-drag alternatives |

### 9.3 Beyond compliance

WCAG is the floor. The users in personas P1 and P5 need more:

- **Spoken status** in the user's language (FR-10.4) — the same string the screen reader gets.
- **Sunlight mode** at 7:1 (FR-5.3), because "readable indoors" is not the use case.
- **Native-script language names** in the picker — a user who needs Hindi cannot read the word "Hindi".
- **Plain language everywhere.** "Reverses at Itarsi — your coach moves to the front" beats "rake reversal at ET". Reading level is an accessibility dimension the WCAG AA floor doesn't cover.

## 10 · Ambient layer constraints *(where this system meets Android reality)*

The selected direction puts the answer outside the app. That surface does **not** get this design system, and pretending otherwise would produce a spec that cannot be built.

| Surface | Framework | Real constraints |
|---|---|---|
| Widget | **Glance** (not Compose) | Restricted composables. No arbitrary shadows, limited custom fonts, no continuous animation. **The flap-roll and the breathe are unavailable.** |
| Live notification | RemoteViews / `Notification.Builder` | OS-controlled styling; Android 12+ enforces its own decoration. Limited layout vocabulary. |
| Full-screen alarm | Full Compose Activity | Full system available. Requires `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT`. |

**Consequences that shape the design, not just the implementation:**

1. **Ambient surfaces carry the *fact*, in-app carries the *nuance*.** The widget shows `~16:49 · PF 4` and its confidence marker; the app shows the reasoning, the timeline, and the basis.
2. **Confidence on ambient surfaces degrades to typography, not motion** — the `~` prefix and a dimmed ink do the work the breathe does in-app. This is why `ESTIMATED` has a *copy* rule (`~16:49`) and not only a visual one: the copy rule is the only one that survives everywhere.
3. **Widget update cadence is OS-throttled** and the exact floor varies by OEM. The freshness stamp is therefore *mandatory* on ambient surfaces — a widget that cannot guarantee recency must state its recency.
4. **Colour tokens must be duplicated as Android XML resources** for RemoteViews, which cannot read the Compose CompositionLocal. This is a genuine duplication risk: the palette can drift between Compose and XML. **Mitigation: generate the XML from the Kotlin tokens, and assert equality in CI.**

**This is the direction's weakest joint** and it remains untested on real hardware (Xiaomi/Oppo/Vivo). Per `direction-study.md` §5, device verification should gate full ambient adoption. The in-app experience is specified to stand complete without it.

### Not yet built

Ordered by dependency. Each is a separate reviewable change; the structural ones need a plan first per `android/CLAUDE.md`.

1. **Finish `ConfidenceValue` adoption.** Confirmation odds now render as `ESTIMATED`. Remaining candidates: the Track timeline's future ETAs, and `STALE` on cached screens — both currently render as certain.
2. **Ambient-light auto-suggest for Sunlight** (FR-5.3). The mode is now user-selectable; the sensor-driven prompt is not built. It must never override an explicit choice, which is why `SunlightStore` holds only the explicit one.
3. **Text reflow to 200%**, replacing the 1.3× clamp (§2.4). The largest outstanding a11y item, and the only one blocking a WCAG AA claim.
4. **`MaskedPnr` type** replacing `String` in UI/analytics — the enforcement mechanism for FR-4.3.
5. **Generated XML colour resources** + CI equality assertion (§10.4).
6. ⚠ **Three-tab restructure** — needs the PRD §7 amendment first.
7. ⚠ **Ambient layer** (Glance widget, live notification) — needs the device matrix first.

## 12 · How to review a screen against this system

1. Count the `displaySmall`. Exactly one, or the hierarchy is wrong.
2. Screenshot it in greyscale. Every status still identifiable?
3. Find every live number. Does each carry a confidence?
4. Turn off the network. Does it degrade, or does it blank?
5. Set text size to 200%. Does it reflow, or clip?
6. Is the primary action reachable by a thumb? Is the destructive one *not*?
7. Is any number proportional-figured? It will jitter on refresh.
